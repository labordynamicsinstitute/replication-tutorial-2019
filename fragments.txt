A bit confusing - stay with me
=======================
In order to better support this tutorial, I "cloned" my main code repository to a new location:

- from  <small>https://</small> **github.com** <small>/larsvilhuber/jobcreationblog</small>
- to <small>https://</small> **gitlab.com** <small>/larsvilhuber/jobcreationblog</small>

and then *froze it*.


(Optional) Bonus points
=======================
If you want to save any modifications you will make, you need to first *fork* my repository yourself:

- use the "Fork" button
- you could also use the "Import project" (Gitlab.com) functionality

and then replace "**your name here**" for all occurrences of "**larsvilhuber**" in the Git URLs shown in the tutorial from here on.
