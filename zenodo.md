Making the document more permanent
==================================



- we could have started on the Open Science Framework (possibly)

***
- we could create a PDF and store it on Cornell's eCommons

- we could submit to a journal!


We are going to use Zenodo

Why Zenodo?
===========
## Because it makes it really easy
- create a hook from Zenodo to Github
- create a release on Github
- a permanent record remains on Zenodo with a DOI [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.400356.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.400356)
  - even if you delete your Github repo!
